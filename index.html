                options: {
                    A: "Blood glucose via aerobic respiration",

                correctAnswer: "D",
                rationale: "For extremely short, high-intensity activities lasting up to about 10 seconds, the muscles rely on the immediately available energy from the pre-existing ATP pool and the rapid regeneration of ATP from creatine phosphate.",
                source: "\"At the start of muscle activity, the first source of ATP is the pre-existing ATP pool and the creatine phosphate system... This process happens almost instantaneously, but the supply is very limited, lasting only a few seconds – typically up to 10 seconds during activities like sprinting or heavy lifting.\" (Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies, Slide 2)"

Which metabolic pathway and substrate are predominantly fueling his muscles during the majority of this run?",

                },
                correctAnswer: "B",
                rationale: "For activities lasting from seconds to a few minutes, muscles shift to using stored muscle glycogen. When the exercise is intense and oxygen is limited, this glycogen is broken down via anaerobic glycolysis, which produces ATP quickly but also generates lactate.",
                source: "\"Glycogen is broken down into glucose, which enters glycolysis, a process that produces ATP quickly but less efficiently than aerobic metabolism. If oxygen is limited, the end product is lactate... This pathway dominates for activities lasting from seconds to a few minutes, such as a 400-meter run.\" (Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies, Slide 2)"

                },
                correctAnswer: "D",
                rationale: "During prolonged, moderate-intensity endurance activities, muscle glycogen stores become depleted. The body then shifts to using free fatty acids as the primary fuel source. Fatty acids are oxidized in the mitochondria to generate a large, sustainable supply of ATP.",
                source: "\"For prolonged exercise, the body shifts to utilizing free fatty acids as a primary fuel source. Fatty acids are oxidized in the mitochondria through β-oxidation and the electron transport chain, generating a substantial amount of ATP.\" (Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies, Slide 2)"

He notes that if he rests for a few minutes and then resumes at a lower intensity, his symptoms improve (a \"second wind\").

                },
                correctAnswer: "B",
                rationale: "Defects in glycogen metabolism, such as McArdle disease (a glycogen storage disease), classically present with exercise intolerance, cramping, and myoglobinuria during brief, high-intensity exercise. This is because the muscle cannot break down glycogen for the rapid energy supply needed for anaerobic activity.",
                source: "\"Classic symptoms of the metabolic myopathies, including exertional fatigue, myalgias, cramping or contractures, and myoglobinuria may emerge during times of high energy demand due to exercise... This explains the characteristic pattern of cramping, stiffness, and myalgias shortly after brief, maximal exertion associated with several of the glycogen storage diseases (GSDs).\" (Metabolic and Mitochondrial Myopathies, Slide 4)"

                },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Fatty acids are the primary fuel source during prolonged, moderate-intensity exercise and during fasting. Disorders of fatty acid oxidation (FAOD) therefore manifest with symptoms of muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis under these specific metabolic stresses.",

                rationale: "Mitochondrial myopathies are caused by mutations affecting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which impairs aerobic energy production. This leads to a multisystem presentation including exercise intolerance, weakness, and lactic acidosis (due to a compensatory increase in anaerobic glycolysis). \"Ragged red fibers\" on biopsy are a hallmark of abnormal mitochondrial accumulation.",
